                The VA Loan provides veterans with a federally guaranteed home loan which requires no down payment. This
                program was designed to provide housing and assistance for veterans and their families.<br><br>

                The Veterans Administration provides insurance to lenders in the case that you default on a loan.
                Because the mortgage is guaranteed, lenders will offer a lower interest rate and terms than a
                conventional home loan. VA home loans are available in all 50 states. A VA loan may also have reduced
                closing costs and no prepayment penalties.<br><br>

                Additionally there are services that may be offered to veterans in danger of defaulting on their loans.
                VA home loans are available to military personal that have either served 181 days during peacetime, 90
                days during war, or a spouse of serviceman either killed or missing in action.

                        The Veteran Administration's Loan originated in 1944 through the Servicemen's Readjustment Act;
                        also know as the GI Bill. It was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was
                        designed to provide Veterans with a federally-guaranteed home loan with no down payment. VA
                        loans are made by private lenders like banks, savings & loans, and mortgage companies to
                        eligible Veterans for homes to live in. The lender is protected against loss if the loan
                        defaults. Depending on the program option, the loan may or may not default.

                        Yes, your eligibility is reusable depending on the circumstance. If you have paid-off your prior
                        VA Loan, and disposed the property, you can have your eligibility restored again. Also, on a
                        1-time basis, you may have your eligibility restored if your prior VA Loan has been paid-off,
                        but you still own the property. Either way, the Veteran must send the Veterans Administration a
                        completed VA Form 16-1880 to the VA Eligibility Center. To prevent delays in processing, it's
                        advisable to include evidence that the prior loan has been fully paid, and if applicable, the
                        property was disposed. A paid-in-full statement from the former lender or a copy of the HUD-1
                        settlement statement must be submitted.<br><br>
