        <div class="faq-item mb-4">
            <h4 class="fw-semibold">When should I refinance?</h4>
            <p class="">
                It's generally a good time to refinance when mortgage rates are 2% lower than the current rate on your
                loan. It may be a viable option even if the interest rate difference is only 1% or less. Any reduction
                can trim your monthly mortgage payments. Example: Your payment, excluding taxes and insurance, would be
                about $770 on a $100,000 loan at 8.5%; if the rate were lowered to 7.5%, your payment would then be
                $700, now you're saving $70 per month. Your savings depend on your income, budget, loan amount, and
                interest rate changes. Your trusted lender can help you calculate your options.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item mb-4">
            <h4 class="fw-semibold">What are points?</h4>
            <p class="">
                A point is a percentage of the loan amount, or 1-point = 1% of the loan, so one point on a $100,000 loan
                is $1,000. Points are costs that need to be paid to a lender to get mortgage financing under specified
                terms. Discount points are fees used to lower the interest rate on a mortgage loan by paying some of
                this interest up-front. Lenders may refer to costs in terms of basic points in hundredths of a percent,
                100 basis points = 1 point, or 1% of the loan amount.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="fw-semibold">Should I pay points to lower my interest rate?</h4>
            <p class="">
                Yes, if you plan to stay in the property for at least a few years. Paying discount points to lower the
                loan’s interest rate is a good way to lower your required monthly loan payment, and possibly increase
                the loan amount that you can afford to borrow. However, if you plan to stay in the property for only a
                year or two, your monthly savings may not be enough to recoup the cost of the discount points that you
                paid up-front.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="fw-semibold">What is an APR?</h4>
            <p class="">
                The annual percentage rate (APR) is an interest rate reflecting the cost of a mortgage as a yearly rate.
                This rate is likely to be higher than the stated note rate or advertised rate on the mortgage, because
                it takes into account points and other credit costs. The APR allows homebuyers to compare different
                types of mortgages based on the annual cost for each loan. The APR is designed to measure the "true cost
                of a loan." It creates a level playing field for lenders. It prevents lenders from advertising a low
                rate and hiding fees.<br><br>

                The APR does not affect your monthly payments. Your monthly payments are strictly a function of the
                interest rate and the length of the loan.<br><br>

                Because APR calculations are effected by the various different fees charged by lenders, a loan with a
                lower APR is not necessarily a better rate. The best way to compare loans is to ask lenders to provide
                you with a good-faith estimate of their costs on the same type of program (e.g. 30-year fixed) at the
                same interest rate. You can then delete the fees that are independent of the loan such as homeowners
                insurance, title fees, escrow fees, attorney fees, etc. Now add up all the loan fees. The lender that
                has lower loan fees has a cheaper loan than the lender with higher loan fees.<br><br>

                The following fees are generally included in the APR:
            <ul>
                <li> Points - both discount points and origination points</li>
                <li> Pre-paid interest. The interest paid from the date the loan closes to the end of the month. </li>
                <li> Loan-processing fee</li>
                <li> Underwriting fee</li>
                <li> Document-preparation fee</li>
                <li> Private mortgage-insurance</li>
                <li> Escrow fee </li>
            </ul><br>
            The following fees are normally not included in the APR:
            <ul><br>
                <li>Title or abstract fee</li>
                <li>Borrower Attorney fee</li>
                <li>Home-inspection fees</li>
                <li>Recording fee</li>
                <li>Transfer taxes</li>
                <li>Credit report</li>
                <li>Appraisal fee</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="faq-item mb-4">
            <h4 class="fw-semibold">What does it mean to lock the interest rate?</h4>
            <p class="">
                Mortgage rates can change from the day you apply for a loan to the day you close the transaction. If
                interest rates rise sharply during the application process it can increase the borrower's mortgage
                payment unexpectedly. Therefore, a lender can allow the borrower to "lock-in" the loan's interest rate
                guaranteeing that rate for a specified time period, often 30-60 days, sometimes for a fee.

        <div class="faq-item mb-4">
            <h4 class="fw-semibold">What documents do I need to prepare for my loan application?</h4>
            <p class="">
                Below is a list of documents that are required when you apply for a mortgage. However, every situation
                is unique and you may be required to provide additional documentation. So, if you are asked for more
                information, be cooperative and provide the information requested as soon as possible. It will help
                speed up the application process.

            <h4 class="fw-semibold">How is my credit judged by lenders?</h4>
            <p class="">
                Credit scoring is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you credit. Information about
                you and your credit experiences, such as your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts you
                have, late payments, collection actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts, is collected
                from your credit application and your credit report. Using a statistical program, creditors compare this
                information to the credit performance of consumers with similar profiles. A credit scoring system awards
                points for each factor that helps predict who is most likely to repay a debt. A total number of points
                -- a credit score -- helps predict how creditworthy you are, that is, how likely it is that you will
                repay a loan and make the payments when due.<br><br>

                The most widely use credit scores are FICO scores, which were developed by Fair Isaac Company, Inc. Your
                score will fall between 350 (high risk) and 850 (low risk).<br><br>

                Because your credit report is an important part of many credit scoring systems, it is very important to
                make sure it's accurate before you submit a credit application. To get copies of your report, contact
                the three major credit reporting agencies:<br><br>

                Equifax: (800) 685-1111<br>
                Experian (formerly TRW): (888) EXPERIAN (397-3742)<br>
                Trans Union: (800) 916-8800<br>
                These agencies may charge you up to $9.00 for your credit report.<br><br>

                You are entitled to receive one free credit report every 12 months from each of the nationwide consumer
                credit reporting companies – Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This free credit report may not contain
                your credit score and can be requested through the following website: https://www.annualcreditreport.com
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item mb-4">
            <h4 class="fw-semibold">What can I do to improve my credit score?</h4>
            <p class="">
                Credit scoring models are complex and often vary among creditors and for different types of credit. If
                one factor changes, your score may change -- but improvement generally depends on how that factor
                relates to other factors considered by the model. Only the creditor can explain what might improve your
                score under the particular model used to evaluate your credit application.<br><br>

                Nevertheless, scoring models generally evaluate the following types of information in your credit
                report:<br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Have you paid your bills on time? Payment history typically is a significant factor. It is likely
                    that
                    your score will be affected negatively if you have paid bills late, had an account referred to
                    collections, or declared bankruptcy, if that history is reflected on your credit report.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What is your outstanding debt? Many scoring models evaluate the amount of debt you have compared to
                    your
                    credit limits. If the amount you owe is close to your credit limit, that is likely to have a
                    negative
                    effect on your score.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How long is your credit history? Generally, models consider the length of your credit track record.
                    An
                    insufficient credit history may have an effect on your score, but that can be offset by other
                    factors,
                    such as timely payments and low balances.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have you applied for new credit recently? Many scoring models consider whether you have applied for
                    credit recently by looking at "inquiries" on your credit report when you apply for credit. If you
                    have
                    applied for too many new accounts recently, that may negatively affect your score. However, not all
                    inquiries are counted. Inquiries by creditors who are monitoring your account or looking at credit
                    reports to make "prescreened" credit offers are not counted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How many and what types of credit accounts do you have? Although it is generally good to have
                    established credit accounts, too many credit card accounts may have a negative effect on your score.
                    In
                    addition, many models consider the type of credit accounts you have. For example, under some scoring
                    models, loans from finance companies may negatively affect your credit score.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Scoring models may be based on more than just information in your credit report. For example, the
            model
            may consider information from your credit application as well: your job or occupation, length of
            employment, or whether you own a home.<br><br>



            To improve your credit score under most models, concentrate on paying your bills on time, paying down
            outstanding balances, and not taking on new debt. It's likely to take some time to improve your score
            significantly.

            <h4 class="fw-semibold">What is an appraisal?</h4>
            <p class="">
                An Appraisal is an estimate of a property's fair market value. It's a document generally required
                (depending on the loan program) by a lender before loan approval to ensure that the mortgage loan amount
                is not more than the value of the property. The Appraisal is performed by an "Appraiser" typically a
                state-licensed professional who is trained to render expert opinions concerning property values, its
                location, amenities, and physical conditions.

            <h4 class="fw-semibold">What is PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)?</h4>
            <p class="">
                On a conventional mortgage, when your down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price of the home
                mortgage lenders usually require you get Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) to protect them in case you
                default on your mortgage. Sometimes you may need to pay up to 1-year's worth of PMI premiums at closing
                which can cost several hundred dollars. The best way to avoid this extra expense is to make a 20% down
                payment, or ask about other loan program options.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item mb-4">
            <h4 class="fw-semibold">What is 80-10-10 financing?</h4>
            <p class="">
                Surprising as it may seem, some folks with hefty incomes find that it's mighty tough for them to save
                enough money to make a 20% cash down payment on their dream homes. Using conventional financing, such
                buyers must purchase Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) which increases the cost of home ownership and,
                ironically, makes it even more difficult to qualify for the mortgage. However, if you're a dues-paying
                member of the cash-challenged class, don't despair. Given that your income is sufficiently high, it's
                eminently possible to avoid getting stuck with PMI. That is why 80-10-10 financing was invented. It is
                called 80-10-10 because a savings and loan association, bank, or other institutional lender provides a
                traditional 80% first mortgage, you get a 10% second mortgage, and make a cash down payment equal to 10%
                of the home's purchase price. By using this method, you are no longer obligated to take out PMI on your
                property.<br><br>

                The same principle applies if you can only afford to make a 5% down, 80-15-5 financing is also
                available. However, because a smaller cash down payment increases the lender's risk of default, do not
                be surprised when you are asked to pay higher loan fees and a higher mortgage interest rate for 80-15-5
                than you pay for 80-10-10.

        <div class="faq-item mb-4">
            <h4 class="fw-semibold">What happens at closing ?</h4>
            <p class="">
                The property is officially transferred from the seller to you at "Closing" or "Funding".<br><br>

                At closing, the ownership of the property is officially transferred from the seller to you. This may
                involve you, the seller, real estate agents, your attorney, the lender's attorney, title or escrow firm
                representatives, clerks, secretaries, and other staff. You can have an attorney represent you if you
                can't attend the closing meeting, i.e., if you're out-of-state. Closing can take anywhere from 1-hour to
                several depending on contingency clauses in the purchase offer, or any escrow accounts needing to be set
                up.<br><br>

                Most paperwork in closing or settlement is done by attorneys and real estate professionals. You may or
                may not be involved in some of the closing activities; it depends on who you are working with.<br><br>

                Prior to closing you should have a final inspection, or "walk-through" to insure requested repairs were
                performed, and items agreed to remain with the house are there such as drapes, lighting fixtures,
                etc.<br><br>

                In most states the settlement is completed by a title or escrow firm in which you forward all materials
                and information plus the appropriate cashier's checks so the firm can make the necessary disbursement.
                Your representative will deliver the check to the seller, and then give the keys to you.<br><br>
