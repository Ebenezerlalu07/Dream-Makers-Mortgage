                        What is a credit report?
                    </h5>
                    <p>Your credit payment history is recorded in a file or report. These files or reports are
                        maintained and sold by "consumer reporting agencies" (CRAs). One type of CRA is commonly known
                        as a credit bureau. You have a credit record on file at a credit bureau if you have ever applied
                        for a credit or charge account, a personal loan, insurance, or a job. Your credit record
                        contains information about your income, debts, and credit payment history. It also indicates
                        whether you have been sued, arrested, or have filed for bankruptcy.</p>

                    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">
                        Do I have a right to know what's in my report?
                    </h5>
                    <p>Yes, if you ask for it. The CRA must tell you everything in your report, including medical
                        information, and in most cases, the sources of the information. The CRA also must give you a
                        list of everyone who has requested your report within the past year-two years for employment
                        related requests.</p>

                        What type of information do credit bureaus collect and sell?
                    </h5><br>
                    Credit bureaus collect and sell four basic types of information:<br>

                    <span class="bold"> Identification and employment information</span><br>
                    Your name, birth date, Social Security number, employer, and spouse's name are routinely noted. The
                    CRA also may provide information about your employment history, home ownership, income, and previous
                    address, if a creditor requests this type of information.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold"> Payment history </span><br>
                    Your accounts with different creditors are listed, showing how much credit has been extended and
                    whether you've paid on time. Related events, such as referral of an overdue account to a collection
                    agency, may also be noted.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Inquiries </span><br>
                    CRAs must maintain a record of all creditors who have asked for your credit history within the past
                    year, and a record of those persons or businesses requesting your credit history for employment
                    purposes for the past two years.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold"> Public record information </span>
                    Events that are a matter of public record, such as bankruptcies, foreclosures, or tax liens, may

                        What is credit scoring?
                    </h5>
                    <p>Credit scoring is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you credit.
                        Information about you and your credit experiences, such as your bill-paying history, the number
                        and type of accounts you have, late payments, collection actions, outstanding debt, and the age
                        of your accounts, is collected from your credit application and your credit report. Using a
                        statistical program, creditors compare this information to the credit performance of consumers
                        with similar profiles. A credit scoring system awards points for each factor that helps predict
                        who is most likely to repay a debt. A total number of points -- a credit score -- helps predict
                        how creditworthy you are, that is, how likely it is that you will repay a loan and make the
                        payments when due.<br><br>

                        The most widely use credit scores are FICO scores, which were developed by Fair Isaac Company,
                        Inc. Your score will fall between 350 (high risk) and 850 (low risk).<br><br>

                        Because your credit report is an important part of many credit scoring systems, it is very
                        important to make sure it's accurate before you submit a credit application. To get copies of
                        your report, contact the three major credit reporting agencies:<br><br>

                        Equifax: (800) 685-1111<br>
                        Experian (formerly TRW): (888) EXPERIAN (397-3742)<br>
                        Trans Union: (800) 916-8800<br>
                        These agencies may charge you up to $9.00 for your credit report.<br><br>

                        You are entitled to receive one free credit report every 12 months from each of the nationwide
                        consumer credit reporting companies – Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This free credit report
                        may not contain your credit score and can be requested through the following website:

                    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">
                        Why is credit scoring used?
                    </h5>
                    <p>Credit scoring is based on real data and statistics, so it usually is more reliable than
                        subjective or judgmental methods. It treats all applicants objectively. Judgmental methods
                        typically rely on criteria that are not systematically tested and can vary when applied by
                        different individuals.</p>

                    <!-- Source of Funds -->
                    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">
                        How is a credit scoring model developed?
                    </h5>
                    <p>To develop a model, a creditor selects a random sample of its customers, or a sample of similar
                        customers if their sample is not large enough, and analyzes it statistically to identify
                        characteristics that relate to creditworthiness. Then, each of these factors is assigned a
                        weight based on how strong a predictor it is of who would be a good credit risk. Each creditor
                        may use its own credit scoring model, different scoring models for different types of credit, or
                        a generic model developed by a credit scoring company.<br><br>

                        Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, a credit scoring system may not use certain
                        characteristics like -- race, sex, marital status, national origin, or religion -- as factors.
                        However, creditors are allowed to use age in properly designed scoring systems. But any scoring
                        system that includes age must give equal treatment to elderly applicants.</p>

                    <!-- Debt or Obligations -->
                    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">
                        How reliable is the credit scoring system?
                    </h5>
                    Credit scoring systems enable creditors to evaluate millions of applicants consistently and
                    impartially on many different characteristics. But to be statistically valid, credit scoring systems
                    must be based on a big enough sample. Remember that these systems generally vary from creditor to
                    creditor.<br><br>

                    Although you may think such a system is arbitrary or impersonal, it can help make decisions faster,
                    more accurately, and more impartially than individuals when it is properly designed. And many
                    creditors design their systems so that in marginal cases, applicants whose scores are not high
                    enough to pass easily or are low enough to fail absolutely are referred to a credit manager who
                    decides whether the company or lender will extend credit. This may allow for discussion and
                    negotiation between the credit manager and the consumer.

                    <!-- Debt or Obligations -->
                    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">
                        What can I do to improve my score?
                    </h5>
                    Credit scoring models are complex and often vary among creditors and for different types of credit.
                    If one factor changes, your score may change -- but improvement generally depends on how that factor
                    relates to other factors considered by the model. Only the creditor can explain what might improve
                    your score under the particular model used to evaluate your credit application.<br><br>

                    Nevertheless, scoring models generally evaluate the following types of information in your credit
                    report:<br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <span class="bold">Have you paid your bills on time? </span><br> Payment history typically
                            is a
                            significant factor. It is
                            likely
                            that your score will be affected negatively if you have paid bills late, had an account
                            referred
                            to
                            collections, or declared bankruptcy, if that history is reflected on your credit report.
                        </li>
                        <li> <span class="bold"> What is your outstanding debt?</span><br> Many scoring models evaluate
                            the
                            amount of debt you
                            have compared
                            to
                            your credit limits. If the amount you owe is close to your credit limit, that is likely to
                            have
                            a
                            negative effect on your score.</li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="bold"> How long is your credit history? </span><br> Generally, models consider
                            the
                            length of your credit track
                            record.
                            An insufficient credit history may have an effect on your score, but that can be offset by
                            other
                            factors, such as timely payments and low balances.

                        <li> <span class="bold">Have you applied for new credit recently? </span><br> Many scoring
                            models consider whether you have
                            applied
                            for
                            credit recently by looking at "inquiries" on your credit report when you apply for credit.
                            If
                            you
                            have applied for too many new accounts recently, that may negatively affect your score.
                            However,
                            not
                            all inquiries are counted. Inquiries by creditors who are monitoring your account or looking
                            at
                            credit reports to make "prescreened" credit offers are not counted. </li>
                        <li><span class="bold"> How many and what types of credit accounts do you have? </span><br>
                            Although it is generally good to
                            have
                            established credit accounts, too many credit card accounts may have a negative effect on
                            your
                            score.
                            In addition, many models consider the type of credit accounts you have. For example, under
                            some
                            scoring models, loans from finance companies may negatively affect your credit score.</li>
                    </ul><br><br>
                    Scoring models may be based on more than just information in your credit report. For
                    example,
                    the
                    model may consider information from your credit application as well: your job or occupation,
                    length
                    of employment, or whether you own a home.<br><br>

                    To improve your credit score under most models, concentrate on paying your bills on time, paying
                    down outstanding balances, and not taking on new debt. It's likely to take some time to improve your
                    score significantly.

                        What happens if you are denied credit or don't get the terms you want?
                    </h5>
                    <p>If you've been denied credit, or didn't get the rate or credit terms you want, ask the creditor
                        if a credit scoring system was used. If so, ask what characteristics or factors were used in
                        that system, and the best ways to improve your application. If you get credit, ask the creditor
                        whether you are getting the best rate and terms available and, if not, why. If you are not
                        offered the best rate available because of inaccuracies in your credit report, be sure to
                        dispute the inaccurate information.<br><br>

                        If you are denied credit, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act requires that the creditor give you a
                        notice that tells you the specific reasons your application was rejected or the fact that you
                        have the right to learn the reasons if you ask within 60 days. Indefinite and vague reasons for
                        denial are illegal, so ask the creditor to be specific. Acceptable reasons include: "Your income
                        was low" or "You haven't been employed long enough." Unacceptable reasons include: "You didn't
                        meet our minimum standards" or "You didn't receive enough points on our credit scoring
                        system."<br><br>

                        If a creditor says you were denied credit because you are too near your credit limits on your
                        charge cards or you have too many credit card accounts, you may want to reapply after paying
                        down your balances or closing some accounts. Credit scoring systems consider updated information
                        and change over time.<br><br>

                        Sometimes you can be denied credit because of information from a credit report. If so, the Fair
                        Credit Reporting Act requires the creditor to give you the name, address and phone number of the
                        credit reporting agency that supplied the information. You should contact that agency to find
                        out what your report said. This information is free if you request it within 60 days of being
                        turned down for credit. The credit reporting agency can tell you what's in your report, but only
                        the creditor can tell you why your application was denied.</p>
